# ADR-1006: Developer Experience — Client Libraries + OpenAPI Spec + CI Drift Check

**Status:** In Progress
**Date proposed:** 2026-04-19
**Date started:** 2026-04-25
**Date completed:** —
**Related plan:** `docs/plans/ConsentShield-V2-Whitepaper-Closure-Plan.md` Phase 6
**Depends on:** ADR-1002 (every `/v1/*` endpoint must exist and be stable), ADR-1009 (cs_api Bearer-token auth shape stable), ADR-1014 Phase 4 (v1 surface mutation-locked at 100% so the SDK can rely on regex/scope/rate-tier helpers being correct).
**Related gaps:** G-002, G-003, G-024, G-045

## Scope amendments (2026-04-25)

The proposal listed four languages (Node, Python, Java, Go). This ADR ships **three** — Node, Python, Go — per the user-confirmed v2 split. Java is dropped from the immediate scope:

- Indian BFSI + healthcare ICP skews to Node/Python/Go; Java demand has not surfaced in any partner conversation to date.
- The original ADR text already positions Java as "lower-priority than Node + Python" — formalising the deferral rather than carrying a paper deliverable.
- Java can be added back as its own ADR if an enterprise prospect requires it; the OpenAPI spec (Phase 3 deliverable, already shipped at `marketing/public/openapi.yaml`) means a Java client could be code-generated rather than hand-written.

The endpoint surface has grown since this ADR was drafted. The current `/v1/*` set is 21 routes (per `find app/src/app/api/v1 -name route.ts`):

| Group | Endpoints |
|---|---|
| Health | `/v1/_ping` |
| Account | `/v1/keys/self`, `/v1/plans`, `/v1/usage` |
| Property | `/v1/properties`, `/v1/purposes`, `/v1/score` |
| Consent | `/v1/consent/record`, `/v1/consent/verify`, `/v1/consent/verify/batch`, `/v1/consent/events`, `/v1/consent/artefacts`, `/v1/consent/artefacts/[id]`, `/v1/consent/artefacts/[id]/revoke` |
| Rights | `/v1/rights/requests` |
| Deletion | `/v1/deletion/trigger`, `/v1/deletion/receipts`, `/v1/deletion-receipts/[id]` |
| Audit & security | `/v1/audit`, `/v1/security/scans` |
| Connectors | `/v1/integrations/[connector_id]/test_delete` |

Each method on the SDK maps to one of these routes. The Phase 1/2/3 sprint deliverables below are amended in place to reference the actual route names.

## OpenAPI status

`marketing/public/openapi.yaml` already exists (2211 lines, served at `https://consentshield.in/openapi.yaml`, linked from `/docs` nav under Reference, listed in the Cmd-K palette). Phase 3 of this ADR (originally "spec completion + CI drift check") is partly de-scoped: the spec file is in tree; what remains is the `scripts/regenerate-whitepaper-appendix.ts` generator + the CI drift check that fails the build when `app/src/app/api/v1/**/route.ts` and `marketing/public/openapi.yaml` diverge.

---

## Context

The whitepaper §5.4 promises client libraries in Node.js, Python, Java, and Go that ship with a 2-second default timeout and fail-closed behaviour (`CONSENT_VERIFY_FAIL_OPEN=true` opts out, with the override recorded in the audit trail). This is not a library-convenience feature; it is the compliance posture ConsentShield promises by default. A BFSI customer that calls the verify endpoint with no client library and no configured timeout will, in many common failure modes, default-open and silently act on withdrawn consent — the worst DPDP outcome. The libraries encode the correct default.

Appendix A of the whitepaper is a hand-written table of `/v1/*` endpoints. Once ADRs 1001–1005 land, that table needs to match code exactly. A CI check that regenerates Appendix A from an OpenAPI spec and fails the build on drift is how we prevent the document from decaying over time (CC-F + G-045).

This ADR delivers libraries and the spec-as-SSOT commitment.

## Decision

Ship four languages and one specification:

1. **Node.js library (G-002)** — `@consentshield/node` on npm at v1.0.0. Methods: `verify`, `verifyBatch`, `recordConsent`, `revoke`, `triggerDeletion`, plus artefact-CRUD helpers. Fail-closed default with env override. TypeScript types. Express + Next.js integration examples.
2. **Python library (G-003)** — `consentshield` on PyPI at v1.0.0. API parity with Node. Python 3.9+. Django + Flask + FastAPI examples.
3. **Java + Go libraries (G-024)** — `com.consentshield:consentshield-client:1.0.0` on Maven Central; `github.com/consentshield/go-client` Go module. API parity. Spring Boot (Java) + net/http (Go) examples.
4. **OpenAPI spec + CI drift check (G-045)** — `app/public/openapi.yaml` becomes the single source of truth for `/v1/*`. `scripts/regenerate-whitepaper-appendix.ts` emits markdown; CI fails if Appendix A diverges.

## Consequences

- Every `/v1/*` shape change in future PRs must edit both the code and the OpenAPI spec (enforced by CI). The whitepaper Appendix A regenerates automatically.
- Customers integrating in Node or Python can go from "npm install / pip install" to first verify call in under an hour (target documented in README).
- The `CONSENT_VERIFY_FAIL_OPEN` override is an explicit compliance trade-off: it is opt-in, it is documented, and it writes to the customer's audit trail. This matches the whitepaper's §5.4 stance exactly.
- Java + Go are lower-priority than Node + Python (the Indian BFSI + healthcare customer base skews heavily to Node/Python); they ship in the same ADR for convenience and to hold the API conventions stable across all four languages.
- Library maintenance becomes a per-release discipline: a `/v1/*` shape change bumps the libraries' minor version.

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Node.js library (G-002)

#### Sprint 1.1: Package scaffold

**Deliverables:**
- [x] New Bun workspace at `packages/node-client/` (chose monorepo over standalone repo to keep the SDK in lockstep with the v1 API surface; the OpenAPI spec, the integration tests, and the Phase 4 mutation suites all live in this repo).
- [x] Package scaffolding: `package.json` (`@consentshield/node` v`1.0.0-alpha.1`, ESM-only, `engines: ">=18"`, exact-pinned devDeps per Rule 17), `tsconfig.json` (extends `tsconfig.base.json` + ES2022 + node + vitest globals types), `vitest.config.ts`, `README.md` (alpha-status banner + quickstart + compliance-posture defaults table + error-model summary + config reference).
- [x] **Source files:**
  - `src/errors.ts` — `ConsentShieldError` base + `ConsentShieldApiError` (RFC 7807 `problem` field exposed) + `ConsentShieldNetworkError` (transport failures, retried before surfacing) + `ConsentShieldTimeoutError` (never retried — second attempt would compound past the consent-decision budget) + `ConsentVerifyError` (compliance-critical — wraps the underlying cause when a verify call fails closed). Every error carries an optional `traceId` lifted from the response's `X-CS-Trace-Id` header (ADR-1014 Sprint 3.2 contract).
  - `src/http.ts` — `HttpClient` class. Builds `${baseUrl}/v1${path}?${query}`. Bearer auth + `Accept: application/json` + JSON-body marshalling + Content-Type stamping. **2-second default timeout** via `AbortController` composed with caller-supplied `signal`. **Exponential backoff** at 100 ms / 400 ms / 1 600 ms (bounded so even `maxRetries=3` stays within ~2 s of cumulative wait). **Retry policy:** 5xx + transport errors retried up to `maxRetries`; **never** retries on 4xx (caller bug) or timeouts (compounds latency past budget); **never** retries when caller-supplied `AbortSignal` aborts (re-throws caller's `AbortError`). Returns `{ status, body, traceId }`. 204 → null body; non-JSON 2xx → text body. Problem-document parsing is content-type-aware + tolerates non-JSON 5xx bodies (`problem: undefined`).
  - `src/client.ts` — `ConsentShieldClient` constructor. Validates `apiKey` starts with `cs_live_` (case-sensitive, defends against `CS_LIVE_` / `cs_test_` / opaque-key callers). Validates `timeoutMs > 0` (positive finite) + `maxRetries >= 0` (non-negative integer). Resolves `failOpen` from option OR `CONSENT_VERIFY_FAIL_OPEN=true`/`1` env var (option wins when explicit). Trims trailing slashes off `baseUrl`. Exposes `baseUrl` / `timeoutMs` / `maxRetries` / `failOpen` as readonly so test asserts can read them. Ships one method this sprint: `ping()` against `/v1/_ping` — useful as a deploy-time health check of the Bearer key + base URL.
  - `src/index.ts` — public re-exports. Sprint 1.1 surface: `ConsentShieldClient` + `ConsentShieldClientOptions` + the five error classes + `ProblemJson` + `FetchImpl` + `HttpRequest`.
- [x] **Tests:** 38 cases across three test files.
  - `tests/errors.test.ts` (7 cases) — instanceof hierarchy / `name` field correctness / message composition (status + detail / fallback to title when detail empty or absent / fallback to "HTTP {status}" when problem undefined) / `traceId` propagation through every subclass / `ConsentVerifyError.cause` chaining.
  - `tests/http.test.ts` (24 cases) — happy-path GET (URL composition with `/v1` prefix + Bearer + Accept) / POST with JSON body + Content-Type / `X-CS-Trace-Id` request + response round-trip / query-string composition skipping undefined+null values / 204 → null body / **timeout fires + throws `ConsentShieldTimeoutError`** (with `vi.useFakeTimers` + `.rejects` attached BEFORE timer advance to avoid `PromiseRejectionHandledWarning`) / **timeout never retries** (single fetch call after 5 retries configured) / 5xx retry up to N + succeeds on Nth attempt / 5xx retry exhausted → `ConsentShieldApiError` with status + traceId / network error retry → `ConsentShieldNetworkError` after N attempts / 4xx never retries (sweep across 400/401/403/404/410/422) / `maxRetries: 0` honoured (single attempt) / caller `AbortSignal` re-throws caller's `AbortError` / RFC 7807 problem-body parsing onto `error.problem` / non-JSON error body tolerated.
  - `tests/client.test.ts` (7 cases) — constructor accepts valid `apiKey` + applies SDK defaults / honours custom `baseUrl` (trims trailing slashes) / honours custom `timeoutMs` + `maxRetries` / rejects missing options / rejects non-string `apiKey` / rejects wrong prefix (`sk_live_`, `cs_test_`, `CS_LIVE_`) / rejects non-positive `timeoutMs` (0 / negative / Infinity) / rejects non-integer or negative `maxRetries` / honours explicit `failOpen=true` / reads `CONSENT_VERIFY_FAIL_OPEN=true|1` from env when option absent / explicit `failOpen=false` overrides env / treats env=falsy as `false` / `ping()` GETs the right URL with the Bearer header.

**Architecture note — published-package layout deferred to Sprint 1.4.** The package currently exports TS source directly (`main: src/index.ts`). This works for internal monorepo consumption + Vitest. Sprint 1.4 adds the dual ESM+CJS build via `tsup` + `.d.ts` emission and flips `exports`/`main` to point at `dist/`. Holding off the build step now avoids paying for it on every sprint commit — the API surface is still in flux.

**Tested:**
- [x] `cd packages/node-client && bun run test` — 38 passed (3 files) — PASS
- [x] `cd packages/node-client && bun run typecheck` — clean — PASS

**Status:** `[x] complete 2026-04-25 — Bun workspace + ConsentShieldClient + HttpClient + 5 error classes + ping(); 38 unit tests pass; typecheck clean. v1.0.0-alpha.1 in package.json. Ready for Sprint 1.2 (verify + verifyBatch).`

#### Sprint 1.2: Verify + verifyBatch methods

**Estimated effort:** 2 days

**Deliverables:**
- [ ] `client.verify({ propertyId, dataPrincipalIdentifier, identifierType, purposeCode })` → typed response matching §5.1
- [ ] `client.verifyBatch({ propertyId, purposeCode, dataPrincipalIdentifiers })` → typed array response
- [ ] Input validation (client-side) matching server-side constraints
- [ ] Fail-closed behaviour: network failure throws `ConsentVerifyError` (not "assumed granted")
- [ ] `CONSENT_VERIFY_FAIL_OPEN=true` env var check: when set, catches the error and returns a `{ status: 'open_failure', reason: ... }` shape; writes an audit record via the `/v1/audit/override` endpoint (to be added)

**Testing plan:**
- [ ] Verify happy path against mock server
- [ ] Timeout + fail-closed: default throws
- [ ] Fail-open env override: catches, audits, returns alternate shape
- [ ] Batch with 10k → ok; 10,001 → throws before network call

**Status:** `[ ] planned`

#### Sprint 1.3: Record + revoke + triggerDeletion + artefact helpers

**Estimated effort:** 2 days

**Deliverables:**
- [ ] `client.recordConsent(...)` → returns `{ eventId, artefactIds, createdAt }`
- [ ] `client.revokeArtefact(id, { reasonCode, actorType })`
- [ ] `client.triggerDeletion(...)` → returns receipt IDs
- [ ] `client.listArtefacts({ ... })` with cursor iteration
- [ ] `client.getArtefact(id)`
- [ ] `client.listRightsRequests({ ... })` + `client.createRightsRequest(...)`

### Phase 3: OpenAPI spec completion + CI drift check (G-045)

#### Sprint 3.1: Full spec + Appendix A generator

**Estimated effort:** 2 days

**Deliverables:**
- [ ] `app/public/openapi.yaml` covers every `/v1/*` endpoint shipped in ADRs 1001–1005 with full request/response schemas, scopes, error shapes
- [ ] Spec published at `https://api.consentshield.in/openapi.yaml`
- [ ] `scripts/regenerate-whitepaper-appendix.ts` reads OpenAPI and emits the Markdown table that replaces Appendix A in the whitepaper

**Testing plan:**
- [ ] `redocly lint` passes
